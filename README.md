This website consists of a responsive CSS boilerplate and HTML, no compiling or installing. The interactive charts are hosted indefinitely on Datawrapper. 

This is a secure and open source storage solution where the dashboard can live forever, for free. We can direct a custom URL to this webpage. Users can also migrate the dashboard to their own server by downloading these files.
